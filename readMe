# DASHBOARD - API

Description

In this third project, the main tool is to consume APIS, with a base of HTML5, JavaScript and Css for the styles. Particularly, this web page allows us to compare international currencies, in addition, printing the data in a graph used via Chart.js and canvas, in the functions for data consumption we use fetch and async await. We work on this project in a modular way, importing and exporting data between files.
Finally, the project was created on Git hub as a repository. Also, to creating a web page via Netlify.

After that, you will be able to observe the value of the currencies on their different dates, both in the same graph to see their differences.
