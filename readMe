DASHBOARD-API

Description

This project created based on JavaScript, also using HTML5 and CSS.
In this second project, we created a website using the 4 CRUD operations, a process to manipulate our data, specifically, a list of tasks, where we can create, read, update and delete information.
In addition, we can save our data in local storage, using DOM object structures, among other JS functions.

Visual

<a href="#start"><img id="" src="Assets\Img\image.png" alt="visual"></a>

Starting

With this information, you will be able to clone the repository, observe it and make some modifications via pull request.

Pre-Requirements

    To run it correctly, we need the following:

    - A working web browser.
    - An active github account.
    - Download visual studio code in your browser.

Installation

For a correct installation, follow the steps below:

    - Clone the project in Github.

        git@github.com:Manumunozco/AIR-UDD.git

    - Go to the project directory.

        cd AIR-UDD.git

    - Open the Index.html file in your browser.

How to use it

To run tests in the browser is very simple, it is not an automated page, the data must be entered manually. That is, type the information in the boxes that are requested.

The task manager allows us to enter the information, save it and read it in our browser. Also, we can edit it and remove incorrect information or information that does not seem necessary.
